### Hi there 👋

I'm Christian, a Senior PHP developer (Team Lead) with 9+ years of experience in the field, currently working on an [international classified portal](https://www.linkedin.com/company/autoline-market/mycompany/).


In essence, I specialize in PHP, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, and IntelliJ Platform (plugin development). When not coding, my love for travel has led me to over 20 countries 🌍. I'm also into cooking, photography, and experimenting with music.


**I'm firmly glued to my team (hehe) and currently not open to job proposals.** However, I'm always keen to give new things a go and have a bit of fun, so if you want to chat about software development, or you are also passionate about traveling, don't be shy - [give me a shout](https://www.instagram.com/the.homeless.cat)!
